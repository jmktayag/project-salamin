# Branch Protection Rules

This repository has both **local Git hooks** and **GitHub branch protection rules** to prevent direct commits to protected branches.

## Protected Branches
- `develop` (main development branch)
- `master` (production branch)
- `main` (alternative production branch)

## Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Local Git Hooks üî®

Two Git hooks are configured to provide immediate feedback:

#### Pre-commit Hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
- **Prevents**: Direct commits to protected branches
- **Triggers**: When you run `git commit`
- **Message**: Shows clear instructions for creating feature branches

#### Pre-push Hook (`.git/hooks/pre-push`)  
- **Prevents**: Direct pushes to protected branches
- **Triggers**: When you run `git push`
- **Message**: Provides early feedback before hitting GitHub's protection

### 2. GitHub Branch Protection Rules üõ°Ô∏è

GitHub repository settings enforce:
- **Pull Request Required**: All changes must go through PRs
- **Direct Push Blocked**: Remote repository rejects direct pushes
- **Review Required**: PRs may require approvals before merging

## Correct Workflow ‚úÖ

### For New Features:
```bash
# 1. Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add your feature description"

# 4. Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Visit GitHub and create PR from feature branch to develop
```

### For Bug Fixes:
```bash
# 1. Create fix branch
git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# 2. Make fixes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve bug description"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/bug-description
```

## Error Messages You Might See

### Local Pre-commit Block:
```
üö´ BLOCKED: Direct commit to 'develop' branch is not allowed!
```

### Local Pre-push Block:
```
üö´ BLOCKED: Direct push to 'develop' branch is not allowed!
```

### GitHub Remote Block:
```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed
remote: - Changes must be made through a pull request.
```

## Benefits

1. **Early Feedback**: Local hooks catch issues before network operations
2. **Consistent Process**: Enforces PR-based workflow for all contributors  
3. **Code Quality**: Ensures all changes go through review process
4. **Branch Stability**: Keeps protected branches stable and deployable

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Working?
```bash
# Check if hooks are executable
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-*

# Make executable if needed
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

### Need to Bypass Hook? (Emergency Only)
```bash
# Skip pre-commit hook (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency fix"

# Skip pre-push hook (not recommended)  
git push --no-verify
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Bypassing hooks defeats the protection purpose. Use only in true emergencies and ensure proper PR process follows immediately.

## Hook Installation

The Git hooks are automatically active when you clone this repository. If hooks are missing, they can be recreated manually or restored from backup.
