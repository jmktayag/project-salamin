# Save and Review Feedback Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

The application already has a robust feedback storage system in place:

- **FeedbackStorageService**: Complete IndexedDB-based storage system for interview sessions
- **FeedbackHistory**: Full-featured component to view past interviews and detailed feedback
- **Storage Integration**: Already implemented in InterviewOrchestrator with session creation and feedback saving
- **Data Structures**: Well-defined interfaces for storing feedback, analysis, and session metadata

## Current Issues Identified

1. **Save Feedback Button**: Currently exists but has no implementation (line 960 in InterviewOrchestrator.tsx)
2. **Review Feedback Button**: Exists in InterviewSummary but calls empty function (line 765)
3. **Missing Individual Question Save**: No ability to save feedback for a single question during interview

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Save Feedback Button
- Implement the `handleSaveFeedback` function in InterviewOrchestrator
- Add immediate save functionality for current question feedback
- Show user confirmation when feedback is saved
- Handle cases where storage is not available

### Phase 2: Enhance Review Feedback Functionality  
- Implement the `onReviewFeedback` callback in InterviewSummary
- Create a detailed feedback review modal/component
- Show question-by-question breakdown with expandable sections
- Add ability to export individual question feedback

### Phase 3: Improve User Experience
- Add save indicators/status for each question
- Implement auto-save functionality as backup
- Add keyboard shortcuts for save actions
- Show storage status and available space

### Phase 4: Additional Features
- Add ability to add personal notes to saved feedback
- Implement feedback comparison across multiple sessions
- Add search functionality within saved feedback
- Create feedback analytics/trends view

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify:
1. **InterviewOrchestrator.tsx**: Implement save feedback functionality
2. **InterviewSummary.tsx**: Add review feedback modal/component
3. **FeedbackStorageService.ts**: Add methods for individual question saves (if needed)
4. Create new component: **FeedbackReviewModal.tsx**

### Key Features:
- Immediate save with visual confirmation
- Graceful degradation when storage unavailable
- Comprehensive review interface with filtering/search
- Export functionality for individual questions
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

## Success Criteria
- Users can save feedback for individual questions during interview
- Users can review all saved feedback in detailed view
- All feedback is properly persisted in IndexedDB
- UI provides clear feedback about save status
- Review interface is intuitive and feature-rich

## Architecture Overview

### Current Feedback Flow
```
Interview Question → User Response → AI Feedback Generation → Display Feedback → Save to Storage (auto)
```

### Enhanced Feedback Flow
```
Interview Question → User Response → AI Feedback Generation → Display Feedback → Manual Save Option → Save Confirmation
                                                                                ↓
Review Summary → Review Feedback Button → Detailed Review Modal → Export Options
```

### Storage Architecture
The application uses IndexedDB through FeedbackStorageService with the following data structure:

```typescript
interface StoredInterviewSession {
  metadata: InterviewSessionMetadata;
  questionFeedbacks: StoredQuestionFeedback[];
  analysis: StoredInterviewAnalysis | null;
}
```

Each question feedback includes:
- Question ID and text
- User response
- AI feedback items (success/warning/suggestion)
- Timestamp
