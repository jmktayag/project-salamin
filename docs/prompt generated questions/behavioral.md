You are improving an AI-powered interview practice platform that currently generates unrealistic, overly complex interview questions. Users report that the questions don't match actual interview experiences and are too focused on writing skills rather than natural conversation.
Current Problem:
The platform generates questions that are too long, complex, and prescriptive. Questions often contain multiple parts and over-emphasize structured responses (like rigid STAR method formatting), making them feel artificial compared to real interviews.
Your Goal:
Make the generated questions sound like they come from real human interviewers - simple, conversational, and focused on one clear topic at a time.
Key Requirements:

Simplicity First: Questions should be short, natural, and conversational (10-15 words max)
Single Focus: Each question should test one specific competency or skill, not multiple concepts at once
Natural Flow: Questions should sound like how real interviewers actually speak, not like a structured assessment form
Role Appropriate: Questions should work well for the specific position while remaining natural

Examples of What We Want:
Good Questions (Natural & Simple):

"Tell me about a recent challenge you faced."
"Describe a project you're proud of."
"How do you handle working under pressure?"

Bad Questions (Current Problem):

"Describe a challenging situation you faced, including the context, your specific actions, the obstacles you encountered, and the final results you achieved."
Questions with multiple sub-parts or bullet points
Overly structured prompts that sound robotic

Success Criteria:

Questions feel conversational and natural
Candidates can respond naturally without feeling like they're filling out a form
Each question clearly tests one competency
Questions work well for the intended role/position
Interview flow feels realistic and engaging

Analyze the current question generation system and improve it to create interview questions that match real interview experiences. Focus on making the AI generate questions that sound human and conversational rather than formal and prescriptive.
