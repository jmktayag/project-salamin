Phase 1 Claude Code Prompt: Question Analysis & Restructuring
You are analyzing and restructuring the interview questions in an AI-powered interview practice application to make them more realistic and focused.
Current Problem:

Questions are too complex with multiple parts in one question
Not realistic compared to actual interview scenarios
Need better separation between technical and behavioral assessment

Your Task:
Analyze the current question structure in app/data/interviewQuestions.ts and restructure the questions to be more interview-realistic.
Specific Actions:

Audit Current Questions:

Identify questions that contain multiple concepts or require multiple answers
Categorize questions by complexity level and scope
Flag questions that don't match real interview patterns


Restructure Multi-Part Questions:

Break down complex questions into focused, single-concept questions
Ensure each question tests one specific skill or knowledge area
Maintain the original intent but make each question standalone


Create Question Variants:

For technical questions: Create progressive difficulty levels (Junior/Mid/Senior)
For behavioral questions: Ensure each focuses on one specific competency
Add role-specific variations where appropriate


Improve Question Quality:

Make questions sound more natural and conversational
Ensure questions are commonly asked in real interviews
Add appropriate context where needed
