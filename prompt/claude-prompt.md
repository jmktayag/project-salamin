1. Performance Optimization Considerations
For React components with frequent updates:

Consider using useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Implement debounced auto-save for better UX (currently requires manual save)
Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance
2. User Experience Enhancements
Auto-save functionality - Current implementation only saves on button click
Form validation feedback - Consider real-time validation with user-friendly messages
Progress indicators - Loading states during save operations
3. Accessibility Considerations
ARIA labels - Ensure all form controls have proper accessibility labels
Keyboard navigation - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
Screen reader support - Test with screen readers for form sections
4. Security Best Practices
Rate limiting - Consider implementing rate limiting for profile updates
Input sanitization - Add XSS protection for bio/text fields
Data validation - Ensure server-side validation matches client-side rules
