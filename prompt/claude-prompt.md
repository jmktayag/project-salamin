Create a floating hint panel system that positions hints optimally across devices. Requirements:
- Implement a floating panel positioned to the right of the main content on desktop (min-width: 1024px)
- Convert to bottom sheet modal on mobile devices (max-width: 1023px)
- Add a persistent "?" or "ðŸ’¡" icon button for hint access
- Include smooth slide-in animations (transform: translateX for desktop, translateY for mobile)
- Ensure panel doesn't obstruct main content with proper z-index layering
- Add backdrop blur effect when panel is open on mobile
- Implement click-outside-to-close functionality
- Include keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Tab to navigate within)
- Ensure panel maintains fixed positioning during scroll
- Add resize observer to handle orientation changes gracefully
