Implementation Notes
Test Coverage:

✅ TopNavigation component now has comprehensive test coverage
✅ Sign-out redirect functionality is tested
✅ Navigation state changes are verified through tests
✅ Authentication flows, user interactions, and error handling are covered

Navigation Approach Decision:

✅ Using setCurrentPage('home') instead of resetNavigation() for sign out
✅ This preserves interview state if user accidentally signs out
✅ resetNavigation() is reserved for intentional navigation resets (logo clicks)
✅ Sign out should only handle authentication state, not reset application state
